# selfhost-quadlets
A repository sharing the quadlet configuration I'm creating over time for my own services.

Writing Quadlets is absurdibly time-expensive, and that's the reason behind this repository:
* to backup my configurations;
* to share them to anyone else needing a "pre-configured" Quadlet.

Inside every service folder you will find a short, **incomplete** README.md with **some** instructions to use the Quadlets.

**You will need some pre-existing skills to use these files, they are not meant as a tutorial in any way.**

## To anyone with bad intentions
I'm extensively using secrets for sensitive values, all the services are not exposed to the internet and I removed/mangled any kind of remaining sensitive data from the quadlets.

Don't even try, you are wasting your time.
